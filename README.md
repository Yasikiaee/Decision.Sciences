## Welcome to My Page

I am Yasaman. I am a decision scientist. I got my PhD in Management Science from the Information Technology and Decision Sciences department at the University of North Texas. I am passionate about exploring people’s attitudes towards using cutting-edge technologies in their daily lives and helping companies better understand their potential customers. My PhD dissertation was about investigating people’s motives to use a specific transportation mode, such as ridesharing or self-driving vehicles. I developed a survey specifically for people’s expectations of self-driving vehicle features! 
I created this page to share my research ideas and findings with everyone.
